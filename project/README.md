# SIMPLE PDF READER
#### Video Demo:  <URL bit.ly/3EwmdPi>
#### Description:
This is python-based simple pdf-reader with 1 reason to be written: open .pdf files

Project uses Tkinter GUI library

CS50 codespace does not support external libraries and git

In order to run my project, one needs to download everything as 1 folder

Or just clone my repo with git to one's IDE

This PDF reader converts opened files to pictures and puts everything
in fullscreen. User can exit fullscreen with keybind Control-E

During developing this project I've read plenty of documentation and tutorial, e.g. :
--GTK(it all began with C, but I had issues running it on Windows)
--GIT
--Tkinter
--Pillow (PIL)
--Different python libraries developed to work with pdf (they are small each but it summed up to 2 days of research)
--Some OS python features
--EXE

Word 'simple' in the begging of header means that project is primitive
Program can't zoom, smoothscroll, support touchscreen and load big files fast
There are ways to implement these features, I've found two of them on Stackoverflow 
They aren't done due to lack of time (I am submitting assignment more than 3 weeks from the day I began it)

Reading docs is timeconsuming but it was a great lesson to me

As this is the last cs50 project I would like to say thank you, cs50 team! 
You did a really great job to cover that much of information in just 2 month of studding
I am now thinking to read Bjarne Stroustrup Programming! The bible of C++
Hope it will be my greatest mistake, but I find it really joyfull to learn programming

If you have any questions...well, I hope you can contact me on video video

Have a nice day!
